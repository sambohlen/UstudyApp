## Introduction
This module required me to create a responsive single-page web application that would help the students at Solent University. The first section of the unit required research and a design for the application. After dedicated research I focused my idea on the time-management and organisational skills of the students. One statement reported that 80%-95% of students in college engaged in procrastination, Ellis & Knaus (2002). Assessment two was the next stage of the assignment. After completing the design in the first section of this project it was then time to develop what I had originally created. The app I created was called Ustudy and would allow users to log in/signup, input their course modules with project deadlines as well as set a timer to see how much work they have accomplished. The aim behind implementing these ideas into the app is to reduce procrastination within students’ lives. To develop this application, I would be delving into React Js. This would be my first time discovering react so it was interesting to see how I would enhance my skills in this language and also what other languages would help me along the journey. 

## Methodologies 
For the first module I explored a few different methods to find which was suited to the brief. I used a Design Thinking method which I applied throughout the first module. As this module is building the application, I needed to decide on a development methodology to help construct and plan my app. The two methods that stood out when approaching this project was Waterfall and Agile. Waterfall which was first created in 1970 is a traditional method which requires plenty of structure and is split up into different steps. However, I decided to take an Agile approach as due to being new to React JS there may have been some changes along the way to the design and the agile approach accommodates these. Although this method is used a lot with collaboration, I think due to client satisfaction being the highest priority with Agile it suits perfectly with the development plan. The Agile approach also allowed me to create user stories which benefited my organisational skills. Throughout the project I noticed I was using users’ stories to solve a coding problem.

### Methods
To initialize firebase in my application I first needed to create a firebase project. Once this was initiated, I focused on setting up firestore databases. After researching different ways to connect your database with Firebase V9 I created two databases. The first database would take in the user’s project title and the due date. I decided on these two inputs as they were important to my problem statement. Ideally these inputs would help users to track their deadlines and stay on track of their university modules. The second database collection was for the timer. Once the user would finish with the timer, they would input how many hours they completed. This would then log in the database and showcase on the homepage so the user would see their recent logs. I believe this is useful to students as they feel like they have benefited from studying as well as having a figure to show how much work they have completed.

## Conclusion/Results
During the development stage I had to overcome lots of obstacles to get the results I wanted. When reflecting on the difference between the design and the outcome there are a couple minor changes with components that have been styled differently. Although the card slider on the home page has changed, I still think this design works to overcome the problem statement and clearly showcases users their projects. Further down the homepage I made the decision to remove the histogram section which portrayed the users’ hours that week. Initially I was hesitant to remove this section as it added value however, I replaced this section with a timing log which submits the users time they have worked on their project from the timer page and displays this on the homepage. I believe this version of the design is a lot more user friendly and encourages the user to engage more with the application. Looking at one of the challenges I faced at the start of this build included my knowledge of the React JS library. After completing the weekly tasks assigned by our tutor this helped me to grow my understanding of this and became comfortable to start building the application. When I approached this build, I noticed that recently the firebase and react-router-dom software had both been updated with some key changes. As I wanted to keep this application running with modern software, I chose to apply my knowledge of the previous versions and apply it to the latest updates. This included a new way of installing firestore in the application and react-router-dom replaced 'Switch' and 'useHistory' with Routes and useNavigate. Along with a few other minor changes this meant I was using up-to-date software which was key for future developments of this application as a restructure of the application wouldn't be needed. The application allows users to sign up which logs their email and password in the firebase database. When designing this app, I also wanted users to be able to sign in with third-party software to make it more efficient and a quicker log in time for the user. I set up the google authentication as this is one of the most used authentications and as firebase is created by google it was the easiest to initiate in my application which saved me some valuable time. On further reflection to my application, I am pleased with being able to showcase data from the firestore database collections to my homepage. For the user, being able to submit a project then be redirected to the homepage to see it already being uploaded was important to the efficency of the site as well as load times to keep the user experience to a good standard. 

### Improvements
Just like any project completed, I always evaluate my work and see what improvements I could make for future developments or new projects. This application provided some key functionality that showcased my solution was achievable. However, there are a few improvements I would apply for further developments. Toast components are hugely important to applications today as feedback to the user is crucial to keep engagement. I believe adding this to the app would enhance the user experience. In the design stage I created a page that included a timetable, users could add to help track their classes. Although it wasn't important which is why I didn't include it in the initial build I think for future developments this could play a vital role in engaging with the users and keeping the retention rate high. 

To conclude, this project has taught me lots of crucial things for me to take into the web industry. Learning the basics of React JS and Firebase has enhanced my coding skills which I can take into the industry after university. I believe the app itself can be improved but is has the fundamentals included. The problem statement which was to help users to improve time-management and organisation skills has been well demonstrated in this app. The use of a timer, project deadlines and being able to see how much work you are completing are vital for students to study. For further development I would add toast components to engage in more user feedback and add a timetable to track users’ classes. The agile methodology has helped me during this project as I was able to create user stories and demonstrate them in the application. It also allowed me to change design decisions in order to speed up the build time.
